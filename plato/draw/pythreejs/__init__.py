"""
The `pythreejs <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs>`_
backend renders scenes using `three.js <https://threejs.org/>`_
and is ideal for viewing scenes within Jupyter notebooks.

.. note::

    To enable translucency in the pythreejs backend, a primitive must have the
    same value of alpha (less than 1) for all colors.
